### Project Title
Bikeshare interactive platform

### Description
This is an interactive platform designed to provide users with the ability to look into the available Bikeshare data for the cities of Chicago, New York City and Washington. By filtering the data by the avalable cities, by month (January to June) and day of the week, users can find information on the most popular times of travel: month, day (if no month or day filters have been selected), hour of day; most frequently used stations and trip routes, travel time averages and customer related information (user type, gender and year of birth). 

### Files used
bikeshare_Pablo.py
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
Support and advice by Udacity mentors were key, as well as information from sites like geeksforgeeks.org, activestate.com, stackoverflow.com and git-scm.com.
