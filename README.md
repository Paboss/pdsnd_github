### Project Title
Bikeshare interactive platform

### Description
This is an interactive platform designed to provide users with the ability to look into the available Bikeshare data for the cities of Chicago, New York City and Washington. By filtering the data by the avalable cities, by month (January to June) and day of the week, users can find information on the most popular times of travel: month, day (if no month or day filters have been selected), hour of day; most frequently used stations and trip routes, travel time averages and customer related information (user type, gender and year of birth). Additionally, the platform offers the user the possibility of looking into all the raw data available, displaying 5 rows every time the user requests more raw data.

The platform is case insensitive and handles user input error adequately, allowing the user to correct spelling mistakes or requests for non available data. It can be run in the local terminal. It is neccesary to have Python, Numpy and Pandas as well as the files used (referenced in the next section). To access the platform, type the following command line in the terminal: ipython bikeshare_Pablo.py.

### Files used
bikeshare_Pablo.py
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
Support and advice by Udacity mentors were key, as well as information from sites like geeksforgeeks.org, activestate.com, stackoverflow.com and git-scm.com.
